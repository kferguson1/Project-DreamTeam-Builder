#Project-DreamTeam-Builder

At the start of Pokémon’s life, there were 151 Pokémon. With each new game came new Pokémon to catch, trade, and battle. Now, almost 25 years later, there are 898. There’s no way that a player could know them all. Pokémon Dream Team allows you to search for Pokémon from all generations, to build your perfect party. Filter by type, game, and stats. Save and edit them as needed!

DreamTeam is built with html, css, and javascript. The Materialize CSS framework and JQuery are also utilized within the project. We use PokeAPI to gather all of our pokemon information. This project would not be possible without that program. Lorem Picsum was used to randomize the parallax image in the site, giving the user a fresh backdrop each launch of the application.

DreamTeam allows you to search and save pokemon teams, clear them and display your saved team again from local storage.

-DreamTeam is built with-

PokeAPI- (https://pokeapi.co/) <br>
MaterializeCSS- (https://materializecss.com/) <br>
Lorem Picsum- (https://picsum.photos/)

Pokemon and all related characters/logos are properties of Nintendo. We make no claim of ownership and have no intention to monetize this application.

DreamTeam was developed by a trio of programmers. Thank you for looking at our app! :D
