# Project-DreamTeam-Builder

“Pokemon players- you’ve been in this situation before. You’re stuck in a tough gym, or a rough patch of road and you don’t know what to do. Your team just isn’t strong enough. Now you’ll have to spend precious time grinding to progress! However, you feel that with the right team, you could’ve breezed through that challenge. The best trainers know you need the right party for the job. Our goal is to help you find your dream team, this is our tool to accomplish just that.

Pokemon Dream Team allows you to search for pokemon with a variety of categories. Filter by Type, Generation, Stats, or Moves. After committing to a team, save it for later! Edit as you see fit."
